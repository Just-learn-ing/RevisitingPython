'''
Python divides Operations in following groups:
    Arithmetic Operators
    Assignment Operators
    Identity Operators
    Logical Operators
    Membership Operators
    Bitwise Operators
    Comparison Operators
    
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
    addition
    subtraction
    multiplication
    division
    floor division
    modulo
    exponential ---> 2**3 = 2 to the power 3
    
ASSIGMENT OPERATORS:
    =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, &=, |= ,^=, <<=, >>=
    :=  print(x:=3)---> first assign value to x then print x ----------> x=3
                                                                         print(x)

COMPARISON OPERATORS: 
'you know well'

LOGICAL OPERATORS:
and, or, not

IDENTITY OPERATORS:
is    --> Returns true if both variable are same object : x is y
is not

MEMBERSHIP OPERATORS:
x in y: returns true is sequence with specified value is present in the object
x not in y:

BITWISE OPERATORS:
& : Sets all bit to 1 if both bits are 1
| : Sets all bit to 1 if Either of bit is 1
^ : Sets each bits to 1 only if one of two bits is 1
~ : Inverts each bits
<<: left shift
>>: Right shift I do not know about these two

Precedence:
paranthesis
exponentiation
unary + - bit wise not
*, /, //, %
+, -
<<,>>
&
^
|
comparison, identity, membership
not 
and 
or
